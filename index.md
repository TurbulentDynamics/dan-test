# Foreign Aircraft Landings in Ireland - WW2

This website provides a source of information for family, friends and the public interested in finding out more about foreign aircraft and their crews involved in crashes or landings in and around neutral Ireland during the Second World War, 1939-1945.

If a relative of yours is named below, I would be delighted to hear from you in order to add them to a more detailed memorial story page.

Whether you know the name, dates, departure or crash site of the crew, this website hopes to provide you with some additional information you may find useful.

If you would like submit an inquiry to me, please visit the Contact page linked at the top of the page, I'll be happy to assist you to the best of my abilities.

The incidents below are listed chronologically. To search, please press the Ctrl & F keys and insert the keyword(s).
Note: The letters DIS after a name below indicate that the airman survived the incident in Ireland but died or was killed in a later wartime incident, either accident or by enemy action.POW indicates they were later captured by Axis forces while in combat and the letters INT indicate those airmen interned by the Irish authorities.

This may stem from post war hear say and errors by apparent witnesses.  No reliable source of eyewitness to the attack was identified and it seems unlikely that this aircraft loss is real; Quinn p. 156; WRGI Website says crew interned which is incorrect; Frank Forde in 'The Long Watch' makes no mention of the attacking aircraft being lost.  IMA list has only one loss for this date, see above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Aircraft was flying from Ringway to Jurby, crew had to force land in Ireland and both were interned.  Aircraft had turned over during apparent attempt at taking off.  Aircraft was dismantled at the site and removed to Dundalk barracks by the 27 Dec.  Later bought by the Air Corps, renumbered No. 96, port wing, rudder unit, propeller, forward fuselage; elevator and other large sub assemblies needed to be replaced. I couldn't find a loss card for this in RAF Museum. Proctor escaped from internment in July 1941.  Proctor was an Engineering Officer from the Squadron and rose to the rank of Flight Lieutenant in 1943.  He was a prewar member of Strathay Flying Club and passed away in 1979 in Chelsea, London aged 64.  Covington was released in October 1943 as part of the general release.  He returned to combat duty with the RAF until the end of the war, his story is told <a href="http://www.bbm.org.uk/airmen/Covington.htm">here at this link. </a><br> [Refs: AIR 81/4651; Polskie Skrzydla nad Irlandia,  2015 ?ukasz Gredys, Piotr Sikora; Keefer GinI p.171 & 242 for Full names; MA File G2/X/0610 missing and reviewed salvage operation in ACF-S-61.

The sole survivor, Mohaus, was hospitalized with burn injuries for two and a half years.  A local woman Mary Nugent was awarded by the German government for assisting Hohaus with his injuries.  The February 8, 1941 Southern Star carried a large front page article describing the circumstances of the crash.  The five dead crew men are buried in Glencree (Volksbund site).

Machine gun fire from the trawlers brought down thsi aircraft which crashed nearby.  One survivor was seen to get out onto a wing but continuing attacks by the other aircraft prevented the trawlers rescuing anyone.  Only the body of Fw. Schultz was recovered when he was found floating in Kenmare Bay.  He was buried locally but was later moved to Glencree Cemetery, Wicklow.  <br> [Refs: See Cummins/Horgan, LEoI, Chapter 8; Cummin's Information supplied Aug06 & File 01/06; Quinn p.156; MacCarron p.88 photo (one name) & 143; IMA #G8, ]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Anti Aircraft fire damaged the aircraft and wounded the navigator, Lt Grau.  The aircraft were found then by Hurricanes of 316 (Polish) Squadron who targeted this aircraft and caused her such damage that her captain opted to make for Ireland.

Irish Army report however does not seem to mention this aircraft arriving or fuel being supplied from it, see Lerwick L7267 entry above, report states fuel came from trucks via Beleek.

Baronowski took off from West Freugh near Stranraer on a practice flight.  He ran short of fuel and was forced to put the aircraft down in a field belonging to Mr. Halley in Corbally, Tramore at 17:30.  The aircraft had been observed some 45 minutes prior in the area.  The pilot was conveyed to Kildare and interned there until October 1943.    Weather conditions were good.

Having searched for the damaged bomber after breaking off contact he ran low on fuel and finding himself over Ireland rather than Wales elected to make a forced landing. The aircraft was not badly damaged and was bought by the Irish Government and became aircraft No. 94 in the Irish Air Corps.  It was later returned to the RAF when a batch of Hurricane fighters was delivered in 1943.; Lt Roger Emile Motte was a Free French pilot, flying with the cover name Maurice Remy to protect his family at home in France.  He was released in October 1943 from internment and returned to combat with the Free French units in the RAF.

Part of Convoy OS4.  Aircraft landed at about 13:10. A man visiting the area met the crew on the beach, showed them were they were and helped to turn them about on the beach.  Taking off again at about 13:55, the aircraft flew onto the Eglington base in NI which was being built.  Crew not interned as the aircraft departed beofre authorities got to it.  Weather was extremely bad, heavy rain and strong wind.  There is no mention in this report of fuel being supplied, had any of the authorities known of the landing its likely the crew would have been interned.

Sgt Webster ditched in sea sucessfully but Sgt Woodman was severely injured after being thrown from the aircraft.  Brady and Webster brought him to the life raft and they were picked up by a passing fisherman J Lawlor some hours later.  Sgt Woodman died the next day in Hospital.  He is buried in Mallow, Cork.  Sgt Webster escaped from internment in April 1942 and returned to his former unit, 236 Squadron where he converted to the Beaufighter aircraft.  He failed to return from a recon mission on July 24, 1942.  He was lost along with his navigator/gunner Sgt G R Lewis of the RAF when their Beaufighter X8088 went missing.  Brady was released in October 1943 and went on to win a DFC award for his service with 434 (RCAF) Squadron in Bomber Command. He passed away in 2000.  He visited visited Ireland before his death to visit the grave of Sgt Woodman.  He is credited with supplying the photo of his crew in the book, Flight Into Yesterday. <br> [Refs: McNeill CCL Vol.1 p.158; D'Arcy p.264; CWGC Site, Woodman buried in Mallow, Cork; Notices in RCAF Casualty list 0ct. 29 and 31/41,  IMA #B27; Dwyer p.85 survivors names clearer; MacCarron p.55; Robertson p.160; G O'Regan message 2004, Keefer p.138]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The aircraft had only just shipped from Norfolk, USA in the HMS Illustrious.  S/Lt Girdlestone was interned until he was released in 1943.  He had taken part in many of the escape attempts.

Deemed to be outside territorial waters.  Crew seen to rescued by armed trawler.  The Irish authorities understood the aircraft was a Wellington.  The ORB of 7 O.T.U. records this as : Aircraft B.17.F No 1245160 (Captain W C Milton) with nine crew and two passengers, made a forced landing in the sea of Magilligan Point after a Transatlantic flight, and sank at about 12:00 hours.  Two anti-submarine trawlers rescused the crew.  The Captain fo the aircraft was interogated by S/Ldr. Grenna (Engineer Officer) and a signal was sent regarding suspected sabotage.  The crew were uninjured and were taken by air  in a Douglas D.C.3 to Prestwick.  This loss was recorded as a loss of a Wellington from 7 O.T.U. in some sources, and had been listed as such in this source until 2013.  The ORB for the training unit however lists no such loss.  Two of the crew became prisoners within months while another six were killed in action.  1/Lt Grimes was killed by shell fragments while on a mission to La Pallice, France on November 18, 1942.  1/Lt Levy was killed in action on 3 Jan 1943 over France.  Sgt Cherry, Snover, Garland and Shoemaker were lost on 4 March 1943 when B-17 42-5129 was shot down off the coast of Holland.

Kirschner took off as part of a five aircraft flight from Lands End, England on a 6 to 7 hour flight to Port Lyautey, French Morocco following a B-25 navigation plane. Out over the Bay of Biscay they ran into a severe line squall and the flight broke up while attempting to penetrate. Kirschner tried to return to England, while one other pilot bailed out over Portugal and another was shot down by a Luftwaffe heavy fighter.  Kirschner ended up over Ireland while attempting to return to England.  The aircraft was salvaged by the 12th of March, when it was handed over the border. P J Cummins describes this incident in his book in Chapter 11.  Charles Kirschner had served in the Royal Air Force before transferring to the USAAF. He later served with the 356th Fighter Group in England and flew 52 missions.  He remained in the Air Force after the war and served in Germany for a time.  He was injured in a car accident in the 1950's and passed away in 1967, aged 52, a retired Air Force Major.  His nephew Lance Shawver provided the attached photo which shows Charles probably from his high school days. <br> [MA File G2/X/1138 clearly shows Kirschner as pilot name and signature.

Local people and newspapers mixed up teh 16 June 1942 landing of a British aircraft with Harry Ford's request for information about his 1943 Donegal landing.

The crew were met by guests from the nearby hotel and were dispatched across the border.  The aircraft was dismantled and sent across border.  The crew went on to 379th Bomb Group and eight of them were either killed in action or became POW's in the following months.  John Semach evaded capture and made it back to England.  The bombardier, Harry X Ford, visited Donegal in 1993 and published a book in 2010, named 'Mud, Wings and Wire' which tells his recall of the events in Ireland and in Germany as a POW.  He had visited the wrong town, Portnablagh, based on the memories of locals who were actually recalling the landing of a British Hudson aircraft in June 1942, see above.

Flying from Goose Bay.  The sea conditions made it difficult for crew to reach the one life raft which could be launched.  Five (5) survivors reach Galway on September 16 after 36 hours afloat.  One man, Beckwith, died in raft.  Crew kept in Clifden Hospital until the 21 September.  They were flown home from Lough Neagh on October 1.  The missing are remembered on the Cambridge American Cemetery Tablets of the Missing and buried at Sea.
